# The Maze
<p>The Maze is a 2D PC game, you have to find the treasure before the monsters kill you. You can pick up stronger weapons or reach the health kit to gain extreme amount of hp, there is no max hp. Once you reach the big treasure you have won the game. Have fun! (or try to pretend like you do)
